This project is largely based on the book Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation. 
The code in this book is originally licensed under Apache License 2.0. This license states that any changes must be stated, 
and that this notice is included. The work done here will be licenced under Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, as allowed by the original license (Apache License 2.0).

As to stating changes from the original source:
This isn't as much a copy and edit of the original, as it is a rewrite with the original as reference.
Therefore pretty much everything will differ anywhere from slightly to greatly from the original source code.
The original source can be found on github under the user Matt Pharr:
https://github.com/mmp
And the code specifically referenced for this work can be found here:
https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4

I've chosen to specify pbrt-v4 which has a more restrictive license than pbrt-v3, because I might want to use or reference code in the newer version.
Realistically, most code will be referenced from pbrt-v3:
